# Valor's list

A list of resources, talks, books, articles and various other content which I believe has *actual valuable substance* for someone who wants to further their knowledge of various topics (mainly software engineering).

For some people (even some software engineers) this will probably be a boring list, which contains content, that will put them to sleep. To learn, you must put in the effort, take it slow and pay attention. This is not the place for Youtube shorts, tiktoks or reels. The brain should not rot while watching content from this list! This list aims to be for those who have a sense of curiosity and wish to consume content which in one way or another compels them to think and learn. At the same time this list is aimed for those who are tired of all the buzzwordy, clickbaity, devoid of substance trash content which pollutes the internet more and more each day.

## Pattern for every resource

 - [Title](url to the resource) [type: text|video|audio|image] [DD/MM/YYYY] [tags]
